# Sample project for WPF applications

This sample project shows how to use the SwissQRBill.NET library in a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application. It demonstrates how to display a QR bill and how to print it.

- *Display*: For the display, an *Image* control is used. It is assigned a `DrawingImage` generated by the [`QrBillImage`](QrBillImage.cs) class.

- *Printing*: The class [`QrBillPrinting`](QrBillPrinting.cs) shows how to generate a `DrawingImage`, assigning it to an `Image` control and then adding the control to the page content of a `FixedDocument`.
