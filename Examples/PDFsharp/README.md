# Sample Code for PDFsharp

[PDFsharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net/) is one of the PDF libraries frequently used in .NET project. This sample code demonstrates how to generate PDF documents with QR bills using this library.

The *SwissQRBill.NET* comes with its own light-weight PDF generator. However, if an existing project already uses *PDFsharp*, this code can be helpful. Using *PDFsharp* can also be helpful if the QR bill needs to be added to an existing PDF file.

Two cases are demonstrated:

- Creating a new PDF file with a QR bill
- Copying an existing PDF file and adding the QR bill to it
