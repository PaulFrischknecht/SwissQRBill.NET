# Swiss QR Bill for .NET

Open-source .NET library to generate Swiss QR bills (jointly developed with the [Java version](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill)).

Try it yourself and [create a QR bill](https://www.codecrete.net/qrbill). The code for this demonstration (Angular UI and RESTful service) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBillDemo) as well.

## Introduction

The Swiss QR bill is the new QR code based payment format that will replace the current payment slip starting on 30 June, 2020. The new payment slip will in most cases be sent electronically. But it can still be printed at the bottom of an invoice or added to the invoice on a separate sheet. The payer scans the QR code with his/her mobile banking app to initiate the payment. The payment just needs to be confirmed.

If the invoicing party adds structured bill information (VAT rates, payment conditions etc.) to the QR bill, the payer can automate booking in accounts payable. The invoicing party can also automate the accounts receivable processing as the payment includes all relevant data including a reference number. The Swiss QR bill is convenient for the payer and payee.

## Features

The Swiss QR bill library:

- generates PDF, SVG and PNG files
- generates payment slip (105mm by 210mm), A4 sheets or QR code only
- multilingual: German, French, Italian, English
- validates the invoice data and provides detailed validation information
- adds or retrieves structured bill information (according to Swico S1)
- parses the invoice data embedded in the QR code
- is easy to use (see example below)
- is small and fast
- is free – even for commecial use (MIT License)
- is built for .NET Standard 2.0, i.e. it runs with .NET Core 2.0 or higher, .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher, Mono 5.4 or higher, Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299 or higher, Xamarin etc.
- has a single non-Microsoft dependency: Net.Codecrete.QrCodeGenerator
- available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator/) (named *Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator*)

## Getting started

1. Create a new Visual Studio project for .NET Core 2.x (*File > New > Project...* / *Visual C# > .NET Core > Console App (.NET Core)*)

2. Add the library via NuGet:

   Either via *Project > Manage NuGet Packages...* / *Browse* / search for *qrbill* / *Install*
   
   Or by running a command in the Package Manager Console

```
Install-Package Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator -Version 2.5.3
```

3. Add the code:

```c#
using Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Generator;
using System;
using System.IO;

namespace Codecrete.SwissQRBill.Examples.Basic
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Setup bill data
            Bill bill = new Bill
            {
                // creditor data
                Account = "CH4431999123000889012",
                Creditor = new Address
                {
                    Name = "Robert Schneider AG",
                    AddressLine1 = "Rue du Lac 1268/2/22",
                    AddressLine2 = "2501 Biel",
                    CountryCode = "CH"
                },

                // payment data
                Amount = 199.95m,
                Currency = "CHF",
                
                // debtor data
                Debtor = new Address
                {
                    Name = "Pia-Maria Rutschmann-Schnyder",
                    AddressLine1 = "Grosse Marktgasse 28",
                    AddressLine2 = "9400 Rorschach",
                    CountryCode = "CH"
                },

                // more payment data
                Reference = "210000000003139471430009017",
                UnstructuredMessage = "Abonnement für 2020"
            };

            // Generate QR bill
            byte[] svg = QRBill.Generate(bill);

            // Save generated SVG file
            const string path = "qrbill.svg";
            File.WriteAllBytes(path, svg);
            Console.WriteLine($"QR bill saved at { Path.GetFullPath(path) }");
        }
    }
}
```

4. Run it

## API Documention

See DocFX [API Documentation](https://codecrete.net/SwissQRBill.NET/api/index.html)

## PDF Library

To generate QR bills as PDF files, this library uses its own, minimal PDF generator that requires no further dependencies and comes with the same permissive license as the rest of this library.

If you are already using [iText](https://itextpdf.com/en) or [PDFsharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net/), then have a look at the respective examples:

## More information

This library is the .NET version of Swiss QR Bill. There is also a [Java version](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill) with the same features. More information about both libraries can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill/wiki).
