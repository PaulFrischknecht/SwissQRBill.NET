# Example for a Microsoft Word Add-in

This example is a Microsoft Word Add-in capable of inserting a QR bill into a Word document. The QR bill is inserted as an EMF image for highest quality. It is place at the bottom of the page as prescribed by the Swiss QR bill standard.

The [`InsertQrBill`](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill.NET/blob/master/Examples/MicrosoftWordAddIn/ThisAddIn.cs#L33) function can also be used by any application communicating with Microsoft Words via the *Interop* interfaces.
